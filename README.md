# TEST CASE GENERATOR

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Test Case Generators

## DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM

The current educational landscape calls for an efficient and interactive platform that facilitates the exchange of test cases between students and teachers. To address this need, we have developed a test case generator website that aims to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and accepting test cases. Traditionally, students have faced challenges in finding relevant and diverse test cases to practice their lab experiments. Likewise, teachers have encountered difficulties in providing personalized feedback and evaluating the quality of submitted test cases. Our platform bridges this gap by offering a user-friendly interface where students can submit their test cases, while teachers can seamlessly review and assess them.By leveraging this platform, students gain access to a wide range of test cases shared by their peers, enabling them to enhance their problem-solving abilities and deepen their understanding of the subject matter.
